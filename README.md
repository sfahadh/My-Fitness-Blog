# Fitness Blog

A website of my background as a fitness professional.

## About the Website

This is a fitness blog in which I will eventually use to promote my self as a fitness professional. There are a total of 9 pages and 4 links to different websites.

### Navbar

The navbar has a total of 10 links. There are 6 links that will take the user to different pages of the website. The other 4 are links to different websites. Those 4 are displayed as icons which are youtube, which directs the user to an empty channel of mine,facebooks, which directs the user to my facebook profile, twitter, which will take the user to a 404 page because I don't have one, and instagram, which will take the user to my instagram. 

On the far left of the navbar is an icon with some transition effect. It doesn't do anything else, it is just a representation or logo of my blog. 

### First Page

The first page is the landing page, this is the only page where I added some humor. But when I recreate this, the theme of the landing page will be removed to something more professional. The background image is a batman and robin meme related to fitness. There is an image of Michael Jordan crying and it is bouncing throughout the webpage. In the center of it all is a picture of me, which will take you to a page about me. Right next to the picture of me is a text of what this webpage is and what to expect from it. Also, in one of the links of the navbar, it displays my full name, "Fahad Hussain." This link will take the user back to this page, the landing page.

### Second Page

The second page is the articles page. The articles page contains a slideshow and three links. The three links will take the user to three different articles. The slideshow has arrow buttons on the left and right side of the image. These arrows will display the next or previous image depending on which arrow buttons is clicked. The three links are within an article card. The article card contains the title of the article, an image in reference to the article, and a brief description of the article. There is also a button underneath the description, which will link to the article. 

##### First Article

For the first article, I wrote a paper about the fundamentals of nutrition. I wrote this paper a few months back and made some modifications as I was making this webpage. I added some gifs and images in the article as well as citations, which is essential for the credibility of an academic written research paper. The page looks very basic because the main focus is for the user to just read to paper and not get distracted with other things.

##### Second Article

The second article is just like the first article except that it does not include any images or gif. I wrote this paper back in college and have not modified it since. 

##### Third Article

The third one, just takes the user to a page with an image that basically says that it is under construction. So in the future I will be working on making a paper on that topic.

### Services Page

The services page will display two types of services that I can provide. One is, in person personal training, in which the client can speak and train with me face to face and the other is online coaching, in which I'll speak with the client remotely. These two services will be displayed as headers and have a text discription of the service in the center and an image on both ends. There will be a contact form in the bottom of a page, which will include a button. Clicking the button will lead to a pop-up modal.

### About Me Page

The about me page is basically about myself. On the top part of the page, I talked about the built of this page and in the second part, I go into my background as a fitness professional. Below those two I go over my passion and then my mission statement.

### Products

In the products page, I broke it down into 2 parts, one for calculating Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) and the other are program templates. Each of those parts have subsections. The first part has 2 and the second part has 4. Each of those subsections follow the same format, an image to the left, a header, a text discription under the header and then under the description is a button, which is all to the right of the image. In the first part, the user can find their Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR) by clicking on the button under the RMR header and text description. This will lead to a modal pop-up, which then asks for the user's input. There is a button that will calculate the RMR base on the user's input. With that generated RMR, the user can find his/her TDEE by clicking on the next modal about TDEE. From there, the user selects a number of options based on his/her activity level and give them their TDEE depending on which options he/she chose. 

In the second part about the program templates, each of the modal will have the same message. This part is more of a blueprint for future changes when I do modify it and add actual programs to these subsections. 

### Contact

In the contact page, the user can contact me by first filling out a form and then clicking on the submit button. This will lead to a pop-up modal which will just display message. No other actions will occur.
