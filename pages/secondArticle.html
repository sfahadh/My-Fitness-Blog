            <h1>The Science Behind Heart Rate Variability and It's Role with the Autonomic Nervous System</h1>
            <p>For the past four decades heart rate variability (HRV) has increasingly been used as a biomarker for the
                assessment of autonomic functions and cardiac health (Vescio, Salsone, Gambardella, & Quattrone, 2018).
                But what exactly is HRV, how can it be measured and what’s it role with the autonomic nervous system
                (ANS)? Well, HRV is measured from the use of measuring heart rate (HR). HR is the number of heartbeats
                per unit of time, which is usually one minute. So HRV can be measured from the differences in intervals
                of time between each successful heartbeats. And that gets into what exactly HRV is. By looking at the
                differences in intervals of time between each successful heartbeats, you may see variability in the time
                it takes from one heartbeat to occur to another, and to another, and to another, and so on. This
                variability in time between each heartbeats is what HRV is.</p>
            <p>To answer the second part of the question, HRV can be measured or is usually measured by observing an
                electrocardiographic signal, which is detected from a monitoring system called an electrocardiogram
                (ECG). When using an ECG, one can measure the time interval of heartbeats by looking at the peak of the
                QRS waves. The peak of the QRS wave is represented by the letter R. The R-R interval or its synonymous
                term, interbeat intervals (IBI) are the measurement of the time intervals between any two adjacent R
                peaks in an ECG wave (Vescio, Salsone, Gambardella, & Quattrone, 2018).</p>
            <p>And to answer the third part of the question I’ll be going go into the physiology of the ANS like what
                exactly it is and how it affects us because it is of most importance to really understanding its
                function, which will make it easier to understand its role with HRV. Based on the studies I’ve come
                across, HRV has a lot to do with the autonomic nervous system because it is a huge influencer on heart
                rate and its variability.</p>
            <p>Looking into the broad aspect of the nervous system, it has two main branches, one of which is the
                peripheral nervous system (PNS), which is composed of two major divisions, the motor division and the
                sensory division. Of these two major divisions of the PNS that we should take a more particular interest
                in, is the motor division, which includes the ANS. The ANS is often considered part of the motor
                division and it controls the body’s involuntary internal functions (Kenney, Wilmore, & Costill, p. 85).
                The sensory division also plays a role in affecting HRV through mechanisms such as the effects from
                baroreceptors, chemoreceptors and circulating hormones. The ANS is comprised of the parasympathetic
                nervous system and the sympathetic nervous system (Dong, 2016). They play an important role in physical
                activity, exercise, and even at rest by affecting heart rate, blood pressure, and lung function. They
                regulate processes that are important for maintaining physiological homeostasis and responding to acute
                stressors. They function independently of other adaptive systems (Kenney & Ganta, 2014). They also have
                opposing affects but always work together. They originate from different sections of the spinal cord
                (Kenney, Wilmore, & Costill, p. 85).</p>
            <p>The sympathetic nervous system is sometimes referred to as the fight-or-flight system because of its
                multitude of physiological responses that prepares the body to face a crisis. These multitude of
                physiological responses of the sympathetic nervous system includes: increasing heart rate as well as the
                force of contraction, vasodilation of blood vessels, bronchodilation in the lungs, increase blood
                pressure, and stimulating the release of the catecholamines, epinephrine and norepinephrine. There are
                other physiological responses from the sympathetic nervous system, but these physiological responses are
                of more concern to HRV. The parasympathetic nervous system has opposing effects with the exception to
                blood pressure where it has little to no effect on it and also for the catecholamines where it has no
                effect on it as well. The parasympathetic nervous system is much more active at rest and helps with
                digestion, urination, and conservation of energy. The parasympathetic nerve is often referred to as the
                vagal nerve because the parasympathetic supply to the heart runs in the vagal nerves (Aubert, Seps, &
                Beckers, 2003).</p>
            <p>That summarizes what the ANS is, what it is composed of, and how it effects us. Now I’m going to connect
                it to HRV.</p>
            <p>In the first few paragraphs I described what HRV is and how it can be measured, but I have yet to talk
                about why there is variability in time intervals between heartbeats or to put more simply and shortly,
                the oscillation in the heart rate. The oscillation in the heart rate represents a healthy heart. And a
                healthy heart is complex and constantly changing, which allows the cardiovascular system to rapidly
                adjust to sudden physical and psychological challenges to homeostasis (Shaffer & Ginsberg, 2017).</p>
            <p>The mechanism behind the oscillation in the heart rate can be due to the integration between the nervous
                system and the cardiovascular system. But more specifically between the inputs of the cardiovascular
                regulatory centers located in the spinal cord and medulla and the input of the higher brain center. The
                integration between those higher functioning mechanisms helps adjust heart rate and blood pressure via
                sympathetic and parasympathetic efferent pathways (McCraty & Shaffer, 2015). The medulla is the primary
                site to regulate the parasympathetic and sympathetic nerves outflow to the heart and blood vessels. To
                go into further details, the nucleus tractus solitarius located in the medulla receives sensory input
                and stimulates cardiovascular responses to emotion and stress (Makivic, Nikic, & Willis, 2013).</p>
            <p>Because there is integration between the heart and the efferent pathways of the sympathetic and
                parasympathetic nervous system, HR is regulated by these systems. There is a balance between these two
                systems, which affects the oscillation in heartbeats, which again defines what HRV is (Makivic, Nikic, &
                Willis, 2013). But exactly how do they affect HRV? Well, they innervate the heart and its conduction
                system.</p>
            <p>The ANS supplies both the afferent and efferent nerves to the heart, with the bulk of the myocardium of
                the heart targeted by the sympathetic nerves and the vagal nerves on the SA node (Aubert, Seps, &
                Beckers, 2003). Earlier I mentioned about one of the physiological functions of the sympathetic nervous
                system in which they release epinephrine and norepinephrine. When action potential are conducted by the
                sympathetic nerves, it releases these catecholamines, which leads to an increase in HR and an increase
                in the heart’s force of contraction. But there is a delay in the onset of sympathetic activation on the
                heart, which for a brief moment is five seconds. It can be much longer than that for ongoing sympathetic
                activation. What this means is that the sympathetic nervous system takes too long to take an affect on
                HRV because HRV varies by milliseconds. In contrast the vagal stimulation is much more quicker,
                practically almost instantaneous. So primary changes in the oscillation of the HR is mostly mediated by
                the parasympathetic nervous system (McCraty & Shafer,2015).</p>
            <p>In contrast to what was mentioned on the paper by McCraty & Shafer, “Heart Rate Variability: New
                Perspectives on Physiological Mechanisms, Assessment of Self-Regulatory Capacity, and Health Risk,” the
                sympathetic nervous system does have some indirect influence on HRV by affecting HR.</p>
            <p>In a case when there is no ANS activity on the heart, the intrinsic rate generated by the SA node is
                about 100 beats per minute (bpm). The vagal nerves are the predominant factor influencing HR during
                regular physical activity, rest, or sleep when HR is below a 100 bpm (White & Raven, 2014). So
                essentially you can think of the vagal nerves as the factor that slows down HR to below 100 bpm. During
                mild or intense exertions of physical activity or exercise, as the HR exceeds 100 bpm, the sympathetic
                nerves becomes the predominant influencer (McCraty & Shafer, 2015). But as HR increases from resting
                levels to greater than 100 bpm due to mild or intense exertions of physical activity or exercise, this
                increase in HR is the result of the withdrawal of the vagal nerves (White & Raven, 2014).</p>
            <p>As I mentioned previously the sympathetic nervous system has more of a role on the effect on just the HR.
                But because of that it has an indirect influence in HRV. When HR increases, there is a reduce time
                between successive heartbeats and the opportunity for the R-R interval to vary decreases. This lowers
                HRV, whereas slower HR increases the time between adjacent heartbeats and the chance for R-R interval to
                vary, which increases HRV (Shaffer & Ginsberg, 2017). The relative sympathetic nerve increases causes
                the R-R intervals to become shorter (Thayer, Fredrikson, Sollers III, & Wager, 2011). So as HRV
                decreases, HR increases, which shows an inverse relationship between the two. And the sympathetic
                nervous system can be attributed to this effect.</p>
            <p>As mentioned earlier, oscillation in heartbeats or HRV represents a healthy heart because it allows the
                cardiovascular system to rapidly adjust to sudden physical and psychological challenges to homeostasis
                (Shaffer & Ginsberg, 2017). But over time the oscillation of the heartbeat or HRV will decrease and not
                just acutely such as from exercise, which is a normal healthy physiological function, but progressively
                with aging. Reduced HRV also correlates with and predicts mortality rates in populations with high
                cardiovascular disease (CVD) and low CVD (Borchini et al., 2018).</p>
            <p>According to a paper by Younes and colleagues, HRV is strongly influenced by age, its amplitude increases
                between childhood and adolescence but in adults it starts decreasing with age (Younes, Robert, Barrey, &
                Cottin, 2016). Though the paper was based on a study on male endurance horses, it showed that HRV
                amplitude decreased with age. HRV was also influenced by other factors such as exercise duration,
                temperature, humidity, weather, and ground surface (Younes, Robert, Barrey, & Cottin, 2016). But those
                factors were acute, where as aging is progressive, which has more of chronic impact on HRV. What results
                in lower HRV from aging is due to a reduction in vagal or parasympathetic activity (Umetani, Duda, &
                Singer, 1996). In another paper by Monfredi and colleagues, it suggests that the correlation between a
                decrease in HRV and higher morbidity and mortality is the consequence of the concurrent increase in HR
                (Monfredi et al., 2014). Which supports the earlier statement because there is generally a concurrent
                increase in HR as people age into the their elderly stage.</p>
            <p>From the previous paper I mentioned about earlier on how exercise duration, temperature, humidity,
                weather, and ground surface can affect HRV, from a sports performance perspective; that can be very
                relevant. And using HRV as a parameter to monitor recovery, the ANS is evaluated through different
                methods. The most commonly used methods are frequency-domain, time-domain, and Poincare plot parameters
                (Makivic, Nikic, & Willis, 2013).</p>
            <p>The frequency-domain analysis describes high and low frequency rates of the variability changes,
                corresponding to the activity of different branches of ANS. By applying these frequency differences in
                HRV analysis, the individual contribution of parasympathetic and sympathetic systems were identified
                (Dong, 2016). The individual contributions for both the parasympathetic and sympathetic systems from HRV
                analysis are also identified in the other methods through different statistical measurements. Continuing
                on with the frequency-domain analysis, low frequency (LF) modulation (0.04-0.15 Hz) of R-R interval
                changes corresponds to the sympathetic and parasympathetic activities acting together. High frequency
                (HF) modulation (0.15-0.4 Hz) of R-R interval changes is primarily regulated through innervation of the
                heart through the parasympathetic nerve (Makivic, Nikic, & Willis, 2013).</p>
            <p>In the time-domain parameters, the standard deviation (SD) of all the N-N intervals (SDNN) reflects total
                variability of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. And the root mean square of SDs
                (RMSSD) between adjacent N-N intervals represents parasympathetic activity (Makivic, Nikic, & Willis,
                2013). The N-N interval is synonymous with the term R-R interval. In the In the Poincare plot, the
                standard descriptor 1 (SD1) represents short-term variability in the heart and standard descriptor 2
                (SD2) describes long-term variability in the heart (Fishman, Jacono, & Dick, 2012).</p>
            <p>These are the three most commonly methods used for ANS analysis used in many research papers to gauge HRV
                recovery amongst people and animals, which helps look into a sports performance perspective. Changes of
                ANS activity during and after exercise could provide a great deal of physiological and pathological
                information (Xiang Chen et al., 2017).</p>
            <p>In an example of a paper published by James and colleagues sixteen experienced runners participated for
                the study. Measurements of blood pressure and HRV were recorded 1 hour prior, 1 hour, 24 hours, 48
                hours, and 72 hours post exercise sessions. Subjects were not allowed to perform any exercise 72 hours
                prior to the first assessment or in between any subsequent assessments. Assessments were done in a
                laboratory under controlled conditions such as time of day, humidity, atmospheric pressure, and
                temperature.</p>
            <p>The finding of the study suggests that severe exercise reduced indicators of parasympathetic influence on
                the heart, which was measured from the analysis of the ANS through the Poincare plot and frequency
                domain analysis. It showed statistical significance on SDNN, RMSSD, & HF values. There was also an
                indicator of the sympathetic influence 1 hour post exercise bout from LF value. (James, Munson,
                Maldonado-Martin, & Croix, 2012). The values reversed 24 hours post exercise bout and then remained
                constant 48 hours and 72 hours post exercise bout. Moderate intensity exercise had no change in either
                sympathetic or parasympathetic influence on the heart.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, HRV is the oscillation in heartbeats, specifically the variability in the interval of time
                between R-R intervals on a QRS wave, which can be tracked on an ECG. There are other modalities of
                tracking HRV, but this is the most common. HRV is associated with the integration between the heart and
                the ANS. The parasympathetic nervous system have much more of an influence on HRV because the
                stimulation it has on the heart is much more quick and instantaneous compared to the sympathetic nervous
                system. And by analyzing the ANS activity, researchers, coaches, doctors, etc., are able to monitor
                recovery/fatigue, determine certain types of health disparities, and determine what environmental
                factors may influence performance and recovery. </p>
