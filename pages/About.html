        <p>Hi! Thank you for visiting my webpage, I really do appreciate you taking your time and reading my
            bio. I am the author, the creator, and the developer of the entirety of this webpage. I structured all the
            functionality and designs that you see with your very own eyes on this page. And so if you have any
            constructive feedback on how I can improve my site or if you just want to give me a compliment on how great
            of a job I did on this site (hopefully that is what you are thinking), then I will greatly appreciate it.
            To reach me out, just go to the contact me page and there you can get a hold of me. Thanks! </p>

    <div class="about">
        <p>So just to give you a background of who I am, I will start off with a brief summary of my credentials.
            I attended Lehman College where I earned a bachelors degree in Exercise Science. I am certified through
            American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) as a Certified Personal Trainer (CPT) and National Strength &
            Conditioning Association (NSCA) as a Certified Strength and Conditioning Specialist (CSCS). I've been a
            personal trainer since 2017 and I've helped many of my clienteles reach their fitness goals, which is a
            great feeling. I take in a lot of pride in my work because I always continuously educate myself to stay
            on top of the scientific literature to make sure that my clients (and myself as well) stay in the best shape
            we possible can in the most healthiest and optimal way.
        </p>

    <p class="moreInfo">I have a huge passion for fitness as well as helping everyone reach their fitness goals because
        I know how it feel to achieve that. I always strive to better myself and I do plan on competing in the future
        (within the next few years). I plan on competing in both bodybuilding and powerlifting (not at the same time
        though). I will keep you updated on it by posting up my progress. I will continuously update this website to
        not only make it more user friendly through feedbacks on how it runs, but also uploading articles backed
        by the scientific literature that I will be going over to get a better understanding on a topic so I can apply
        it on myself and my clients to further optimize goals.<br><br>
    </p>
    <p class="moreInfo" id="mission"><strong>Mission Statement: </strong> I currently work as a personal trainer and
        have
        been since 2017 and I've been
        helping many of my clients achieve
        the physique of their dreams. With this website I want to expand on reaching the number of people I can help
        because I personally saw how great my clients felt and I want to see that around the world. Integrating
        technology into my passion in fitness will help me achieve that by developing applications that can increase
        fitness levels through motivation and education.</p>
