            <h1>The Basis of All Diets: Energy Conservation</h1>
            <p>First, the most import law that must be understood as the general basis for all nutrition related topics
                is the Law of Thermodynamics (specifically the 1st law). It is a fundamental law that governs the
                physical characteristics of the universe. The first Law of Thermodynamics states that energy is
                conserved, it cannot be created nor can it be destroyed, it can only be transformed from one form to
                another (Walsh 413)(Hall 989). So what does that mean? Calories is a unit of energy, specifically 1
                kilocalorie equates to 4184 Joules of energy. For the rest of this article I’m going to refer 1
                kilocalorie to 1 Calorie, notice the capitalization of the letter c, which is often used to denote 1
                kilocalorie and is different from calorie. 1000 calorie equals to 1 Calorie or 1 kilocalorie (Walsh
                413). That may have sound confusing but this is how it is defined, unfortunately. But you don’t have to
                worry so much about that, just know Calories in the food label is synonymous to kilocalories. Since
                Calories equates to 4184 Joules of energy, calories is essentially energy itself so it still holds up to
                the law of Thermodynamics. So calories cannot just disappear, it can only be moved to a different
                location or be stored or expended (keep that in your thought). </p>
            <img src="../images/LawofThermodynamics.jpg" alt="">
            <p>Calories can be calculated because it is on all nutrition labels of food, so the great part is that
                you’ll know how much calories you are consuming if you add up the total amount of calories from the
                foods you ate. Calories in and Calories out (CICO) is the idea that weight gain or weight loss is
                determined by caloric surplus or caloric deficit, regardless of diet composition (Aragon et al). If the
                amount of calories you consume is less than the amount of calories you burn (you burn calories through
                TDEE, more on that later) you will be in a caloric deficit, meaning you’re going to be burning fat (and
                even lean body mass to an extent depending on multiple factors, more on that in a later articles). If
                however the amount of calories you are consuming is greater than the amount of calories you are burning,
                you will be in a caloric surplus and this can result in fat gain and also muscle gain if you do your
                resistance training (you do not have to be in a caloric surplus to gain muscle but more on that in a
                later article). </p>
            <p>So as I mentioned earlier, what is TDEE? TDEE stands for Total Daily Energy Expenditure and it accounts
                for 3 main variables. TDEE is the sum of the resting metabolic rate (RMR), the thermic effect of food
                (TEF) and the energy expenditure in physical activity (EEPA) (McManus, 368)(Levine 667)(DeLany
                85-102)(Levine & Kotz, 309). EEPA can be broken down into two subcomponents, non-exercise activity
                thermogenesis (NEAT) and exercise activity thermogenesis (EAT) (Levine 667).</p>
            <img src="../images/EnergyExpenditure.jpg" alt="">
            <p class="note"><em>This image above does not depict with 100% accuracy for every individual out there, this
                    is just a general average of how much each factors take up of TDEE. All factors can vary between
                    person to person depending on their diet, lifestyle and genetic makeup. </em></p>
            <p>RMR or resting metabolic rate is the minimal amount of calories required just to stay alive (Schrack,
                667). There are many factors that influences RMR such as genetics, age, gender, fat mass, fat-free mass
                (FFM), aerobic fitness level, environmental temperature and altitude, hormonal factors, stress, etc.
                (Broeder 795). RMR accounts for the largest single component of TDEE (Itoi et al. 64), up to 50%-70% of
                total caloric expenditure for most people (McManus, 368)(Aragon et al)(Levine & Kotz, 309). The reason
                why your body requires so much energy just to keep you alive is because there are many, many things
                going on in the body that all requires energy. It does not require so much energy individually, but in
                totality it requires an extraordinary amount. These such things includes cellular functioning,
                contraction of the muscles of the heart, contraction of the smooth muscles that make up the organs in
                your body, releases of hormones, enzyme activities, digestion, neurons of the brain firing, etc. All
                these occur every seconds (some even milliseconds) of every minute of every hour of every day till the
                day you die. That is a ton of energy being expended just to keep you alive, which is why again that RMR
                takes up majority of the calories expended of TDEE.</p>
            <p>TEF or thermic effect of food accounts for only a small percentage of TDEE, generally about 10% (Binns
                204)(McManus, 368). This percentage can vary but not significantly. TEF is the energy expenditure from
                the digestion, absorption, processing and disposal of digested food (Hall 990)(Crovetti 482)(Levine
                667). So to simplify its meaning, eating food burns calories but you will only burn a small portion of
                the calories of the food you consume (some food will lead to greater expenditure of calories in ratio to
                its calorie content compared to others). Protein has a higher TEF compared to carbs and fats and it is
                also more satiating (Crovetti 482)(Binns 204). So a good fat loss strategy is to increase your protein
                intake.</p>

            <p class="note"><em>I took this picture back in college when I took Chemistry. This is a calorimetry, which
                    is used to measure the amount of calories in a food. There is water in the foil and by measuring the
                    temperature of the water before and after the food is burned, which is located right below, you can
                    determine the amount of heat that was absorbed, you will be able to calculate the amount of calories
                    of that particular food using a few equations such as the heat formula. It was quite a while ago so
                    I don’t exactly remember every step. But anyways hopefully you find this interesting</em></p>
            <p>EAT or exercise activity thermogenesis accounts for a portion of TDEE and it can vary greatly from person
                to person. It is the calories burned through exercise (Aragon et al). And not everyone exercises in a
                regular basis or even at all, but that is one end of the spectrum whereas some athletes will exercise
                twice a day almost everyday. These athlete will burn a lot more calories throughout the day than the
                sedentary individual. And that is why there is such a great discrepancy in calories burned through TEE
                amongst many people.</p>
            <p>NEAT or non-exercise activity thermogenesis takes up a chunk of TDEE and it can also vary greatly between
                person to person, even more so than EAT. NEAT is the energy expenditure of everything we do except for
                sleeping, eating and exercise. So things like blinking, working, talking, hand gestures, walking,
                fidgeting, etc (Levine 667)(Levine & Kotz, 309)(Aragon et al) are all subcategorized under NEAT. The
                reason it can vary so much between individuals is because of those thing such as work. There are some
                people who are very active in their jobs such as construction workers or bussers in busy restaurants and
                others who have sedentary jobs such as desk jobs. Between the two there is great discrepancy in physical
                activity. The other factors can also play a huge role in differences in calories burned through NEAT
                such as hand gestures, fidgeting and talking. Throughout the day the more an individual is active in
                those factors, so someone who is very social vs someone who is not can result in big differences in how
                much calories is burned throughout the day. But that is just an example, there are multiple other
                scenarios and factors in which why 1 person may burn a lot more calories through NEAT compared to
                another. </p>
            <div id="mario">
                <img src="../images/MarioDash.gif" alt="">
                <img src="../images/MarioAndLuigi.png" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>As mentioned earlier, NEAT and EAT can both be subcategorized into EEPA and it is also represented in the
                graph on TDEE as activity energy expenditure. Of the big three, EEPA, TEF, and RMR, EEPA is the most
                flexible in that it can vary greatly between individuals (Levine 667)(Levine & Kotz, 309). Even it’s
                individual components which I’ve just mentioned TEA and NEAT varies greatly. EEPA can take as little as
                15% of TDEE or up to 50% of TDEE (McManus, 368).</p>
            <p>In conclusion, the 1st Law of Thermodynamics states that energy cannot be created nor can it be
                destroyed, it can only be transferred from one location to another. This concept is related to calories
                (which is a unit of energy so it abides by this universal law) and it explains why calories is the
                fundamental and basis for all diets alike. If one is is in a caloric deficit, one will lose weight.
                Likewise, if one is in a caloric surplus, one will gain weight. And in between the two if calories
                burned equals to calories consumed, one will be at maintenance. Your next question may be, why is it
                that my weight changes day to day even though I’m at caloric maintenance? That question will be answered
                in a another article as it requires greater details. What accounts for the total amount of calories we
                burn each day is equated into TDEE. And it can be broken down into 3 main categories, resting metabolic
                rate (RMR), thermic effect of food (TEF), energy expenditure of physical activity (EEPA).</p>
            <p>Understanding these fundamentals will give you a basis to knowing how all diet works. The next step is
                doing some calculations to find out whether you’re in a caloric surplus, deficit, or maintenance. The
                first step to that is finding the total amount of calories you burn throughout the day. You can do this
                simply by looking up “calculating TDEE” on google and you’ll be able to find different websites that
                provides calculation on how to find how much calories you expend in a day. (However, remember these are
                all just estimations, they are not 100% accurate of your maintenance calories but it will give you a
                reasonable estimate of it even if it is within a few hundred calories of deviation). You may get
                different estimations from different sites because they may use different calculations and the next best
                thing to do is to stick to that estimation and track your weight on a daily basis and then average it
                out for the week. Then compare the weekly average to depict an accurate reading of whether you are
                gaining, losing or maintaining weight. Below is a way on how to make that calculation.</p>

            <p>From Week 1 to Week 2 and from Week 2 to Week 3 and from Week 3 to Week 4 there were a net loss of 1lb.
                This is a great way to gauge whether you truly gained weight or lost weight or maintained weight because
                weight can fluctuate in a day to day basis (the reason why will be covered in later articles). So if
                your goal is to gain or lose or even maintain weight, track your weight everyday under the exact same
                conditions (to minimize as many factors as possible that affects weight fluctuations) so for example, as
                soon as you wake up in the morning after you did your thing in the bathroom, record your weight. Then
                find the weekly average and compare it week by week just how I did it in the example above.
            </p>
            <p>Going back to TDEE, take a look at the picture below.</p>
            <img src="../images/RMRCalculator.JPG" alt="">
            <p>The image above is a calculation of RMR. After you have calculated your RMR, you want to use that number
                and multiply it with how active your are. This will give you an estimate of your TDEE. Remember that of
                all the components of TDEE, EAA can vary the most between individuals, so be very honest with your
                estimation and if you feel like you’re in range between 2 categories, average those out and then
                multiply it with your RMR.
            </p>
            <img src="../images/ActivityMultiplier.png" alt="">
            <p>For example if you’re in range between light exercise and moderate exercise, meaning you work out 2x week
                but because you are pretty active at work you may feel like you’re at moderate exercise level or
                slightly below, you can choose a number in between light exercise and moderate exercise to multiply it
                with your calculated BMR. So you do not have to be committed to the numbers on that chart, assume which
                exercise level or levels that you’re in and put in what daily calorie needs best fits your description
                of your lifestyle. </p>
            <p>Now that you found the amount of calories you expend each day, you now want to track how many calories
                you consume each day. You can do this by using myFitnessPal or any other app that tracks the calories of
                food. Be honest with yourself so don’t underreport or overreport the calories of the foods that you
                consume. Also use measuring utensils such as measuring cups, measuring spoons, and a food scale to give
                you a more accurate reading of how many calories that particular food has. You’ll be surprise in how
                much or how little serving size for certain foods are. So start using measuring utensils to give you a
                progressively better estimate and gauge of serving size of the regular foods you consume.</p>
            <p>Subtract your calculated energy expenditure with the total calories of the food you consume for the day
                and you should have a net balance. For example: let’s say you burn 3000 Calories per day and you consume
                approximately 2500 Calories per day. Your net balance is 3000 - 2500 = -500 calories. You will be at a
                caloric deficit as it is below 0. So you will be losing weight if you keep this net negative balance
                rate over time. This will approximate to losing up to 1lb of weight per week. And congrats you just
                learned how to lose weight with a simple math problem. If you want to gain weight then in this scenario
                you will be consuming over 3000 calories so you can be in a positive net balance, meaning you will be in
                a caloric surplus.</p>
            <p>Now you should be all set. You now have the understanding of the fundamentals of nutrition. With the
                knowledge of how energy works and the knowledge about the components that comprises of TDEE you will not
                fall for any gimmicks or new trendy diets. You also now know how to estimate how many calories you are
                burning and with tracking your own calories and knowing the best way to track weight, you can stay on
                track of your progress and determine if you are getting closer and closer to reaching your goal of
                weight loss or weight gain or weight maintenance.</p>
            <p>Thank you for your time in reading this fairly long article and I hope you got a lot out of it. Please

            <p><em>Within this post I mentioned that I will cover some materials in later articles to keep this post
                    from being too long. Sorry if you wanted to know the answer now, but it must wait so you can truly
                    absorb this post first, but if you already have the fundamentals now or already have read this
                    article (some of you may be like duhh… how did I get here if I didn’t read the whole article, but
                    just to let you know, there are some who may skip this article or just skim it through, which is
                    perfectly fine if you’re just browsing through), you can click on the links, which will direct you
                    to the articles you’re really interested in.</em></p>
